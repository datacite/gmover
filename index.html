<p>Google Groups Archive Mover</p>

<p>The core of the code is from one of the examples of the
Google Admin-SDK Groups Migration API developer page, and the examples
of the mailbox python module.</p>

<p>Creates a Google Admin-SDK Groups Migration API service object and
inserts all mail in an mbox into a group.</p>

<p>Inserts all mail in an mbox into a google group's archive.</p>

<p>Note, this was written to solve a problem.  Migrating a listserv, which
generates archives that are very mbox like, and can be made an mbox with
a simple edit, to google groups.  The archives turned out to uniformly
not have message-id's, which is bad.</p>

<p>If it didn't write for some reason, like a bad message, we really
didn't care.  So there's a lot of cleanup that can be done.  Code
contributions accepted.  I'm posting this brute-force solution because
I didn't see any other examples out there that were "pay us to do it for
you," and if you're looking at this, you're probably like me, and capable
of taking this thing and tweaking it to what you need and never needing
it again.  Note this is also the first python I've done from scratch that
didn't involve the words hello and world.</p>
