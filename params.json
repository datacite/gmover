Migrating a listserv, which\r\ngenerates archives that are very mbox like, and can be made an mbox with\r\na simple edit, to google groups.  The archives turned out to uniformly\r\nnot have message-id's, which is bad.\r\n\r\nIf it didn't write for some reason, like a bad message, we really\r\ndidn't care.  So there's a lot of cleanup that can be done.  Code\r\ncontributions accepted.  I'm posting this brute-force solution because\r\nI didn't see any other examples out there that were \"pay us to do it for\r\nyou,\" and if you're looking at this, you're probably like me, and capable\r\nof taking this thing and tweaking it to what you need and never needing\r\nit again.  Note this is also the first python I've done from scratch that\r\ndidn't involve the words hello and world.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-65267417-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
